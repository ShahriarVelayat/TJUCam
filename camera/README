This directory contains the code running on every Camera Node and Central Node.
It can be compiled on Raspberry Pi with Arch Linux. 
To install the compiled binary on other nodes, upload all the files to Raspberry Pi, and run `sudo ./install_services.sh` .

Please note that code for MVG and Kalman Filtering is replaced by a naive implementation, due to the former code is ruined by hard-coded parameters related to the camera configuration. 

TODO: Automatic calibration using third-party library like OpenMVG or OpenCV.
