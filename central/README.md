This directory contains the code running on Central Node.

Please note that code for MVG and Kalman Filtering is replaced by a naive implementation, due to the former code is ruined by hard-coded parameters related to the camera configuration. 

TODO: 
-  Code is too dirty. (team-work with C++ beginner)
-  Remove precompiled paho.

## Building

### Install Dependencies

1. Install SteamVR.  It is under "Tools" in everyone's Steam Library.  steam://install/250820
2. Fetch the OpenVR SDK 0.9.19 from https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr .  That version SHA is f1ffbf4e92f383bdb453d58f9583c51a5ec350d9.  Newer version should also work with minor changes.

The solution and project files are for Visual Studio 2015.

### Configure Paths

Under "Property Manager" in Visual Studio, expand any of the configurations and find "Paths".  Right click and select "Properties" and then "User Macros".  Modify the paths to match your setup.  InstallDir will be created, and will be configured as an external driver path for SteamVR.

### Build

You will probably want to build Release x86.  You can also build x64.  The post-build step will install the binaries and copy the resources to the configured InstallDir and register that path with SteamVR.

## Using The Hydra Driver 

After building, the InstallDir should be a complete binary distribution.  To use it:

1. Register it with the SteamVR runtime via "vrpathreg adddriver $(InstallDir)".  This is done automatically by a Post-Build step, but if you copy the files elsewhere you will have to do it by hand.
2. Edit your config/steamvr.vrsettings to enable "activateMultipleDrivers".  This is what allows the hydra driver to co-exist with any HMD.  **Be sure to mind your commas.** Check vrserver.txt log to see if there were parse errors.  Many of the settings are described at https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamVR/steamvr.vrsettings .
```{
	...
	"steamvr" : {
        "activateMultipleDrivers" : true
   }
}```
3. If you are trying to use the Hydra driver without an HMD, you might want to enable driver_null (no HMD) or set "requireHmd": false.

After starting SteamVR, you should see controllers blinking in the status window.  Inside the HMD you will see instructions to get the Hydra coordinates aligned with your HMD.  Once you do, the controllers will turn solid green.

You can use "vrcmd" (with no arguments) to see a list of devices to verify things are working.
use "vrcmd" to verify things are loading:

```...
Driver hydra : 2 displays
        Hydra (Serial number hydra0_controller0)
        Hydra (Serial number hydra0_controller1)
...
```

You can also use "vrcmd --pollposes" (followed by an index number to limit the output) to see things are working.
